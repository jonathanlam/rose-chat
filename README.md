 Chat with Rose from Blackpink

This is a quick implementation of a fake-chat bot with my Blackpink bias, Rose.

I wrote this because I was lonely and don't have a girlfriend so this was the next best thing.

# Issues
- Fix behaviour when user enters multiple responses before Rose finishes typing
- Undefined behaviour for some questionable (sometimes rude) user input

# Improvements to work on
- Better name recognition
- Better emotion recognition
- Combine scripted conversations with machine learning
- Better natural language processing

Try it out at [https://jonathanlamao.com/askrose] and if you like this or want to help, you can email me a screenshot of your convo (this will me identify different people's responses to her scripted responses).
